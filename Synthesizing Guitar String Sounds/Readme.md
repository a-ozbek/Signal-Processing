The goal of this project is to create realistic guitar string sounds. For this purpose, I first researched physical modeling concepts of a single guitar string. After this research I concluded that implementing Digital Waveguide Modeling and Karplus- Strong Algorithm would be good choices for my project. Comparing the results of these two methodsâ€™ implementation, which is done by Matlab, showed me that the synthesized guitar string sounds which is done by Karplus-Strong algorithm is more satisfactory than the ones with Digital Waveguide Modeling.
